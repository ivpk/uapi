  [JSON-LD Context](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#the-context) information provided by a URL constructed according to this pattern:
    
    `https://data.gov.lt/{group}/{form}/{org}/{catalog}/{dataset}/{version}/{model}.jsonld`

  Returned object will consist of context information based on the below schema:

    `{`
        "@base": "https://data.gov.lt/datasets/example/City/"
        "_id": "@id"
        "dcterms": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/"
        "name": "dcterms:name"
    `}`
    
  When a context for changes is returned it follows the [LDES](https://w3id.org/ldes/specification#) Event Stream specification.
  
  It will be provided by URL:
    
    `https://data.gov.lt/{group}/{form}/{org}/{catalog}/{dataset}/{version}/{model}/changes.jsonld`
    
  It will follow the below schema:

    `{`
        "ldes": "https://w3id.org/ldes/specification#"
        "_data": "ldes:EventStream"
    `}`
  `_data` in changes is an array (or stream) of `change` objects that are [tree](https://w3id.org/tree/specification):member elements and follow below schema:

    `{`
        "dcterms": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/"
        "ldes": "https://w3id.org/ldes/specification#"
        "_created": "dcterms:created"
        "_id": "dcterms:isVersionOf"
        "_cid": "ldes:versionOfPath"
        
    `}`
  
  When results are divided into several pages, each page is a [tree](https://w3id.org/tree/specification):Node and the page tree
  can be traversed using the `page.next` query element that corresponds to tree:path context.
