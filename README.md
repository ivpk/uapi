## Introduction

This document is an API specification template for all Lithuanian government institutions.

Institutions implementing API should reuse most of the specification as is and only add customizable parts expressed as path parameters or schema fields specified as a pattern.

This specification should be used together with DSA specification.

UAPI provides a template for data exchange protocol and DSA provides schemas.

Final API specification should be generated by combining UAPI and DSA together and this (in future) can be done in Data Portal (data.gov.lt).
