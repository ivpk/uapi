## Introduction

This document is an API specification template for all Lithuanian government institutions. The specification of UAPI web page is available at (https://ivpk.github.io/uapi/).

Institutions implementing API should reuse most of the specification as is and only add customizable parts expressed as path parameters or schema fields specified as a pattern.

This specification should be used together with DSA and DCAT-AP-LT specifications.  The specification of DSA web page in Lithuanian is available at (https://ivpk.github.io/dsa/).
The specification of DCAT-AP-LT web page in English is available at (https://ivpk.github.io/DCAT-AP-LT/en/) and in Lithuanian at (https://ivpk.github.io/DCAT-AP-LT/).

The UAPI provides a template for the data exchange protocol, the DSA provides schemas, and the DCAT-AP-LT provides the structure of the catalog.

Final API specification should be generated by combining UAPI, DSA and DCAT-AP-LT together and this (in future) can be done in Data Portal (data.gov.lt).
