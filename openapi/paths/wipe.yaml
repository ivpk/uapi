    ## To be used by exception only

    ```wipe``` operation is used by exception only, if there were errors in data
    upload scripts, data was currupted due to errors etc. It is best to test
    data upload in test environment.


    Data upload practice of deleting all published data and reuploading it is
    not recommended, since that destroys all if the data change history and it
    may change data IDs. Data should be uploaded once and then updated whith
    what has changed.
