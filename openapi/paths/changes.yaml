  description: |
    Get latest changes to a table.

    If {cid} is not given, return changes, since very first available
    change.

    If {cid} is gven, return only changes, since given change id, including
    change id itself.

    This API can return changes, that were returned previously, client
    should be responsible for checking if a change was received previously
    or not.

    Last change id is included in the request, in order for clients to check
    if last change id matches change received by client. If last change
    does not match, then client should do a full synce, because if last
    change id does not match, that means, that a data migration or some
    other alterations to data were made, which requires to do a full sync.
