description: |
  The main purpose of the `tracestate` HTTP header is to provide additional vendor-specific trace identification information across different distributed tracing systems and is a companion header for the `traceparent` field. It also conveys information about the requestâ€™s position in multiple distributed tracing graphs.

  If the vendor failed to parse `traceparent`, it MUST NOT attempt to parse `tracestate`. Note that the opposite is not true: failure to parse `tracestate` MUST NOT affect the parsing of `traceparent`.

  The `tracestate` field value is a `list` of `list-members` separated by commas (`,`). A `list-member` is a key/value pair separated by an equals sign (`=`). Spaces and horizontal tabs surrounding `list-members` are ignored. There can be a maximum of 32 `list-members` in a `list`. If adding an entry would cause the `tracestate` list to contain more than 32 `list-members` the right-most `list-member` should be removed from the list.
