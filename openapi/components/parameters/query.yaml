        Filter objects where given property is equal to given value.

        Given property names, must be defined in data model.

        Some reserved property names can be used for filtering:

        - `_type`
        - `_id`

        Filters can by done by joining multiple tables if `.` operator is
        used, which means, that two tables if needed must be joined in
        order to perform a filter.

        Last name after `.` can be one of following filter operators:

        - `_gt` - greather than
        - `_ge` - greather than or equal
        - `_lt` - less than
        - `_le` - less than than or equal
        - `_sw` - starts with
        - `_ew` - ends with
        - `_co` - contains
  properties:
    _select:
      type: string
      examples:
        - name,country.name,country.continent.name
      description: |
        Comma separated list of properties to include in the result.

        Special value `*` can be used, to include all properties. This
        can also be used on nested objects, for example `country.*` will
        include all properties from `country` object.

        `-` can be used to exclude a property from result, this will
        exclude properties that were included previously.

        `+` can be used to include additional properties to the result,
        if a property in select list is not prefixed with `+`, then only
        given property will be shown in result, but with `+` a property
        will be added to the result leaving what would by added by
        default.

        By default, all properties of a model will be included.

        When properties are specified in `a.b` form, `.` should join two
        tables and return properties from two tables if needed. This
        requirement only applies if data are stored on the same data
        source. An attempt to join data from multiple data sources,
        should return an error.
    _limit:
      type: integer
      examples:
        - 10
      description: |
        Limit result to given number of objects.

        If `_sort` is not given, then sorty by `_id`.
    _sort:
      type: string
      examples:
        - '-code,country.name'
      description: >
        Comma separated list of properties, optionally prefixed with `+` or `-`
        operators to control sort direction:


        - `+` - ascending sort (1, 2, 3), this is used by default if sort
        direction is not given.

        - `-` - descending sort (3, 2, 1).
    _count:
      type: integer
      description: |
        Return number of objects matching a given filter. If filter is
        not given, return number of all objects.

        Result should be given in following form:

        ```json
        {
          "_data": [
            {"_count": 42}
          ]
        }
        ```
    _or:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        If true, following filters will be interpreted as OR conditions,
        until `_or` is set to false.

        By default, filters are interpeted as AND conditions.

        If `_or` is not turned off, then all conditions are interpreted
        as OR.
    _and:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        If true, following filters will be interpreted as AND conditions,
        until `_and` is set to false.

        By default, filters are interpeted as AND conditions, so usage of
        `_and` makes sense only in an open `_or`.
