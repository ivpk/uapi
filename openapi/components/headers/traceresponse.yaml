  The `traceresponse` HTTP response header field identifies a completed request in a tracing system. It has four fields - `version` `trace-id` `child-id` `trace-flags` separated by `-`.

  Version `version` is an 8-bit unsigned integer value, serialized as an ASCII string with two characters. Version 255 `"ff"` is invalid.

  `trace-id` is the ID of the whole trace forest and is used to uniquely identify a distributed trace through a system. It is represented as a 16-byte array. All bytes as zero `00000000000000000000000000000000` is considered an invalid value. If the `trace-id` value is invalid (for example if it contains non-allowed characters or all zeros), vendors MUST ignore the entire header.

  `child-id` is the ID of the operation of the callee (in some tracing systems, this is known as the `span-id`, where a `span` is the execution of a client request) and is used to uniquely identify an operation within a trace. It is represented as an 8-byte array. All bytes as zero `0000000000000000` is considered an invalid value.

  Vendors MUST ignore the `traceresponse` header when the `child-id` is invalid (for example, if it contains non-lowercase hex characters).
