  Geometry data. Data provided in [WKT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry) format, using [EPSG](https://epsg.org/home.html) database parameters, for different projections.
  It can be presented as:
    - geometry(form, crs) - providing form and coordinate system
    - geometry(crs) - providing coordinate system only
    - geometry(form) - providing form only
    - geometry - no arguments.

  Depending on maturity level:
    - Level 1 - Coordinate system is not defined and data is provided in different coordinate systems. Mixed axes, for example some data is provided as `x, y`, other as `y, x`. Mixed measurements, for example some data is in meters, other in degrees. Adress is provided without coordinates.
    - Level 2 - Coordinate system is not defined, but all data is provided according to a single coordinate system.
    - Level 3 - Data accuracy in meters element `property.ref` is not provided.

type: object
properties:
  form:
    description: Geometry form can have these types - `point`, `linestring`, `polygon`, `multipoint`, `multilinestring`, `multipolygon`. Each of these types can have `z` (height), `m` (selected measurement like time, distance, width, etc.) or `zm` (height and a selected measurement) designations after the type.
