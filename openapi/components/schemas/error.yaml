  More complex errors can further expand this structure.

      For example:
        - "Could not find signature for and: <DaskDataFrameQueryBuilder, Expr>"
        - "Cannot use .astype to convert from timezone-aware dtype to timezone-naive dtype. Use obj.tz_localize(None) or obj.tz_convert('UTC').tz_localize(None) instead."
        - "Property {property!r} not found"
        - "Given value {value} is not defined in enum."
        - "New item has revision already set"
        - "You do not have permission to push this property."
