  In addition to usual HTTP error codes, additional error information available from the processing system is passed to the client.

  This should include a more detailed overview of the internal, business logic or request processing errors that have occurred.

  More complex errors can further expand this structure.

  `status_code` within the error object corresponds to the HTTP error code that will be provided when the error is returned back.
