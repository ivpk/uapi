  `Cache-Control` header should be used if service supports caching. It allows the user to provide directives from their side. `no-cache` can be used to request revalidation of data with the origin server before reuse. `no-store` can be used to request to not store the data in caches.

  Multiple directives can be used separated by `, `. If they are conflicting, most restrictive directive should be honored.
